# 5-Day-Forecast-App-with-ASP.NETCore-MVC
-demo: https://adams-5-day-forecast-app.azurewebsites.net/

## Description 
Welcome to my 5-Day Weather Forecast App! This project was my gateway into the C#/.NET world. It was during building this app that I learned about concepts such as ASP.NET Core, Web API, and 
Model-View-Controller design patterns. 

## Current Features
* Connects with OpenWeatherMap's web API to pull and display 5 days' worth of weather forecast data
  * Implements IHttpClientFactory with Repository pattern

## Intended Improvements
I would like to expand this project by incorporating more data from other web APIs that would display information like popular restaurants in the area or local public parks. 

## Note 
If you intend to use this project, you'll have to set up a (free) account at https://openweathermap.org/api to receive your own personal API key.
